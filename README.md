# Robot-baby
Analysis script for basic sequence processing steps in the Robot-baby project. The steps used in the analysis underlying the results in Hyyti√§inen H et al. (submitted to Microbiome journal) are detailed in the script.sh file. Please note, rather than extensive and detailed scripts we here only mention the basic steps and detail parameters used, but this should allow to reproduce the basic sequence processing. User obviously has to use the correct path to their files and adapt the output naming. Contact the authors for any clarification needed in the code at balamuralikrishna.jayaprakash@thl.fi
